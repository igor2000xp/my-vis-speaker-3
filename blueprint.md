## AI-Powered English Learning Vision Board Blueprint
## Overview
This application will serve as an interactive vision board integrated with an AI-powered English learning tool. Users can set learning goals on their vision board and engage in voice-based conversations with an AI to practice their English. The AI will provide real-time feedback on grammar, pronunciation, and spelling, helping users improve their spoken English skills. Firebase will be used for user authentication, data storage (vision board content, user progress), and potentially cloud functions for AI processing.
## Features
*   **User Authentication:** Secure user login and registration using Firebase Authentication.
*   **Vision Board:**
    *   Create, edit, and delete learning goals (text and potentially images).
    *   Categorize goals (e.g., vocabulary, fluency, grammar).
    *   Mark goals as completed.
*   **AI English Learning:**
    *   AI initiates conversations by asking questions related to learning goals or general topics.
    *   User responds via voice input.
    *   Speech-to-text conversion of user's voice.
    *   AI analysis of user's text for grammar, pronunciation (requires specific libraries/APIs), and spelling errors.
    *   AI generates a spoken response with feedback and corrections.
    *   Text-to-speech conversion of AI's response.
*   **Progress Tracking:**
    *   Display user's learning progress (e.g., number of practice sessions, types of errors made).
*   **Firebase Integration:**
    *   Store user data (goals, progress) in Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database.
    *   Store images for vision board in Firebase Storage.
## Plan for Current Request
The current request is to create a plan for the application. The next step is to start implementing the core structure and basic features.
### Phase 1: Project Setup and Authentication
1.  **Set up a new Angular project:** Create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI.
2.  **Integrate Firebase:** Add Firebase to the Angular project and configure the necessary services (Authentication, Firestore/Realtime Database).
3.  **Implement User Authentication:** Create components and services for user registration, login, and logout using Firebase Authentication.
**Detailed Steps for Phase 1:**
4.  Run `ng new english-vision-board --standalone --style css`
5.  Install Firebase: `ng add @angular/fire`
6.  Configure Firebase in `app.config.ts`
7.  Create `auth` service using `inject(Auth)`
8.  Create `login` and `register` components with forms and integrate with the `auth` service.
9.  Add routing for login and registration pages.
10. Implement authentication guards to protect routes.
